In this folder there are:
read: objects and methods to read all input files, perform checks on allowed values and fill with default values if needed.
      Input file format and keyword are known.

input: Each internal main object has here a corresponding ObjectInput (e.g. FieldInput, MediumInput...) which store all
       the information needed for the internal object initialization. The init method of the internal object needs only
       its own Object input as argument. ObjectInput objects don't know anything of external input structure,
       their attributes are filled by corresponding ObjectSet methods

set: Each Object input has a corresponding ObjectSet which knows the input structure and format, convert it and fill
     ObjectInput attributes


e.g. : ReadInput reads input.dat file which contains
       "SYSTEM" , "WAVEFUNCTION", "FIELD", "MEDIUM", "OPTIMALC", "SAVE"
       sections.
       Perform checks on allowed values, fill empty values with default parameters.

       SetFieldInput takes parameters reagrding the field and fills FieldInput object
       SetMoleculeInput takes names of external quantum codes files in wavefuntion, read them and fills MoleculeInput object


Global input, needed for all the calculations, is read by ReadInput(), set by SetNameInput (e.g. SetMediumInput()) and
stored in NameInput() (e.g. MediumInput())
Then there are specific .conf files different for different calculations that are read by ReadNameConf()
(e.g. ReadGeneticConf()) and set by SetNameConf (e.g. SetGeneticConf)
